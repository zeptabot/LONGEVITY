# **The Longevity System: Reference Guide**

What is this?  
This is a responsive, single-page reference tool (LONGEVITY.html) designed to serve as your personal operating system for healthspan extension. It is based on the principles of Medicine 3.0 (from Peter Attia's Outlive) but engineered to adapt to real-world constraints.  
How it Works  
The system is not a static list of rules. It acts as a decision-making engine with two distinct modes of operation:

## **1\. The Idealized State (The "North Star")**

* **When to use:** When you have autonomy over your time and adequate resources.  
* **The Goal:** Optimization. Strive to check every box in this section.  
* **Core Pillars:**  
  * **Movement Engine:** Zone 2 base (3-4h), VO2 Max peak (1x), Heavy Strength (3x), Stability.  
  * **Nutritional Biochemistry:** Protein anchoring (1.6g/kg), Energy balance, Glucose control.  
  * **Restoration:** Sleep opportunity (8h), Circadian sync.  
  * **Emotional/Cognitive:** Social connection, Purpose, Cognitive load.

## **2\. The Adaptation Logic (The "Survival Kit")**

* **When to use:** When life forces a constraint upon you.  
* **The Goal:** Consistency. Instead of quitting, you apply a specific filter to modify the protocol without breaking the chain.  
* **The 3 Constraint Filters:**  
  * 🔴 **Constraint: TIME (Busy Career/Crunch):**  
    * *Strategy:* Increase Intensity, Decrease Frequency, Integrate Volume.  
    * *Tactic:* Zone 2 becomes lifestyle (commuting/calls), not gym time. Nutrition is outsourced.  
  * 🟠 **Constraint: MONEY (Student/Budget):**  
    * *Strategy:* Sweat Equity, Simplify, Eliminate Frills.  
    * *Tactic:* Gym is replaced by calisthenics/park runs. Food is bulk whole ingredients.  
  * 🟣 **Constraint: STRESS (Burnout/Crisis):**  
    * *Strategy:* Maintenance & Stability.  
    * *Tactic:* **DROP VO2 Max.** Focus entirely on sleep and walking (Zone 2).

## **3\. The Dashboard**

A built-in checklist of the "Medicine 3.0" biomarkers you need to track every 6-12 months (ApoB, HbA1c, ALT, etc.) to ensure the system is working.

Philosophy  
This tool ensures you never have to "stop" your longevity regimen; you simply switch modes. It prioritizes consistency over perfection.
